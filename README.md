# defend-the-fort
Project for FHSU Athletics fundraising

Purpose of this project is to simplify data collection for FHSU Athletic's Defend the Fort campaign.

Reducing input error is the main thought for each step in the process.

There will also need to be a dashboard component for each coach to see statistics about their team
